# Basics of Music Theory

## The Basics

### The Staff, Clefs, and Ledger Lines

#### The Staff
The staff is a set of five horizontal lines and four spaces that each represent a different musical pitch. Notes are placed on the lines and in the spaces.

#### Clefs
Clefs are symbols at the beginning of the staff that determine the pitch of the notes on the staff. The most common clefs are the Treble Clef and the Bass Clef.

- **Treble Clef**: Also known as the G clef, it wraps around the second line of the staff, indicating that this line is the note G above middle C.
- **Bass Clef**: Also known as the F clef, it has two dots above and below the fourth line of the staff, indicating that this line is the note F below middle C.

#### Ledger Lines
Ledger lines are short lines added above or below the staff to extend its range. They allow for the notation of pitches that fall outside the range of the standard five-line staff.

### Note Durations

Notes have different durations, which indicate how long they should be held. The most common note durations are:

- **Whole Note**: A note held for four beats.
- **Half Note**: A note held for two beats.
- **Quarter Note**: A note held for one beat.
- **Eighth Note**: A note held for half a beat.
- **Sixteenth Note**: A note held for a quarter of a beat.

Each note duration has a corresponding rest, which indicates a period of silence for the same length of time.

### Dots and Ties

#### Dots
A dot after a note increases its duration by half of its original value. For example, a dotted half note is held for three beats (two beats for the half note plus one additional beat).

#### Ties
A tie is a curved line that connects two notes of the same pitch, indicating that they should be played as a single note with a duration equal to the sum of both notes.

### Steps and Accidentals

#### Steps
Steps refer to the distance between two pitches. There are two types of steps:
- **Whole Step**: The distance between two notes with one note in between (e.g., C to D).
- **Half Step**: The distance between two adjacent notes (e.g., E to F).

#### Accidentals
Accidentals are symbols that alter the pitch of a note. The most common accidentals are:
- **Sharp (#)**: Raises the pitch of a note by a half step.
- **Flat (b)**: Lowers the pitch of a note by a half step.
- **Natural (♮)**: Cancels a previous sharp or flat.

### Measures and Time Signatures

#### Measures
Measures (or bars) are segments of time defined by a given number of beats. Measures are separated by vertical bar lines on the staff.

#### Time Signatures
Time signatures are notations at the beginning of a piece of music that indicate the number of beats in each measure and the note value that gets one beat. They consist of two numbers:

- **Top Number**: Indicates the number of beats in each measure.
- **Bottom Number**: Indicates the note value that gets one beat (e.g., 4 for quarter notes, 8 for eighth notes).

Common time signatures include:
- **4/4**: Four quarter note beats per measure (common time).
- **3/4**: Three quarter note beats per measure.
- **2/4**: Two quarter note beats per measure.
- **6/8**: Six eighth note beats per measure.

## Rhythm and Meter

### Simple and Compound Meter

#### Simple Meter
Simple meter is a time signature where each beat is divided into two equal parts. Common simple meters include 2/4, 3/4, and 4/4.

- **Duple Meter**: Two beats per measure (e.g., 2/4).
- **Triple Meter**: Three beats per measure (e.g., 3/4).
- **Quadruple Meter**: Four beats per measure (e.g., 4/4).

#### Compound Meter
Compound meter is a time signature where each beat is divided into three equal parts. Common compound meters include 6/8, 9/8, and 12/8.

- **Compound Duple Meter**: Two beats per measure, each divided into three parts (e.g., 6/8).
- **Compound Triple Meter**: Three beats per measure, each divided into three parts (e.g., 9/8).
- **Compound Quadruple Meter**: Four beats per measure, each divided into three parts (e.g., 12/8).

### Odd Meter
Odd meter is a time signature that does not fit into the usual simple or compound categories, and contains a combination of simple and compound beats. These meters have an irregular number of beats per measure, such as 5/4, 7/8, or 11/8.

## Scales and Key Signatures

### Scales
A scale is a sequence of notes in ascending or descending order. The most common scales are the major and minor scales.

- **Major Scale**: A seven-note scale with a specific pattern of whole and half steps (W-W-H-W-W-W-H).
- **Minor Scale**: A seven-note scale with three variations, each with a different pattern of whole and half steps.
  - **Natural Minor Scale**: Natural minor scales follow the pattern of (W-H-W-W-H-W-W) or 212-2122.
  - **Harmonic Minor Scale**: Harmonic minor scales follow the same pattern as natural minor scales except it raises the seventh note by a half-step resulting in the pattern (W‑H‑W‑W‑H‑3Hs‑H) or 212-2131.
  - **Melodic Minor Scale**: Melodic minor scales follow the same pattern as natural minor scales except it raises both the sixth and seventh notes by a half step resulting in the pattern (W-H-W-W-W-W-H) or 212-2221.

Note how in the number pattern it always adds up to 12 thus ending a full octave (12 half steps) above the root.

### Scale Degrees
Scale degrees are the names given to the different notes of a scale. Each degree has a specific name and function within the scale. In a major scale, the degrees are as follows:

1. **Tonic**: The first note of the scale, the root.
2. **Supertonic**: The second (latin for above) note of the scale.
3. **Mediant**: The third note of the scale. (Middle of the tonic and dominant)
4. **Subdominant**: The fourth note of the scale.
5. **Dominant**: The fifth note of the scale.
6. **Submediant**: The sixth note of the scale. (Middle of the subdominant and the upper tonic)
7. **Leading Tone**: The seventh note of the scale, leading back to the tonic.
8. **Tonic**: The last note of the scale.

Notice how the subdominant is the same distance below the upper tonic as the dominant is above the root tonic. A number with a caret may also be used to indicate the scale degree. For example the dominant could be notated as 5&#x0302;.

In a natural minor scale, the seventh degree is called the **Subtonic** instead of the Leading Tone.

### Key Signatures
A key signature is a set of sharp or flat symbols placed at the beginning of a staff to indicate the key of the music. It tells the musician which notes are to be played sharp or flat throughout the piece.

- **Sharp Key Signatures**: Indicate that certain notes are to be played a half step higher.
- **Flat Key Signatures**: Indicate that certain notes are to be played a half step lower.

Note how in the number pattern it always adds up to 12 thus ending a full octave (12 half steps) above the root.

### Key Signatures
A key signature is a set of sharp or flat symbols placed at the beginning of a staff to indicate the key of the music. It tells the musician which notes are to be played sharp or flat throughout the piece. Use the below chart to reference key signatures for both the treble and bass clefs.

- **Flat Key Signatures**: Indicate that certain notes are to be played a half step lower. The flats in the key signature are placed in a specific order and can be remembered with the mnemonic **B**attle **E**nds **A**nd **D**own **G**oes **C**harles' **F**ather.

    `B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭, C♭, F♭`

- **Sharp Key Signatures**: Indicate that certain notes are to be played a half step higher. The sharps in the key signature are placed in the opposite order of the flat key signature and can be remembered with the mneumonic **F**ather **C**harles' **G**oes **D**own **A**nd **E**nds **B**attle.

    `F♯, C♯, G♯, D♯, A♯, E♯, B♯`

### Key Signature Calculation
30 differenent key signatures exist. 15 for major scales and 15 for minor scales. Using the key signature calculation method you only need to remember 7 to calculate the rest. In the calculation method each key signature is assigned a numerical value based on the number and type of accidentals. Sharps are positive (going up in pitch) and flats are negative (going down in pitch).

1. **C Major** has no accidentals, so its value is **0**
2. **D Major** has two sharps, so its value is **2**
3. **E Major** has four sharps, so its value is **4**
4. **F Major** has one flat, so its value is **-1**
5. **G Major** has one sharp, so its value is **1**
6. **A Major** has three sharps, so its value is **3**
7. **B Major** has five sharps, so its value is **5**

To calculate any flat/sharp major keys associated with any note `X`, you add 7 to get the `X♯` major key signature and subtract 7 to get the `X♭` major key signature. For example, if we start with the C Major key signature, we add 7 to get the C♯ Major key signature of 7 (F♯, C♯, G♯, D♯, A♯, E♯, B♯), and conversely, if we subtract 7, we get the C♭ Major key signature of -7 (B♭, E♭, A♭, D♭, G♭, C♭, F♭).

To calculate any minor key signature you simply subtract three from its major counterpart. For example, the C Minor key signature would be C Major, or 0 minus 3 to get -3. So it would be (B♭, E♭, A♭). The flat/sharp minor key signatures simply require two conversions. First, start with the natural major and convert it to the corresponding flat/sharp major key, and then convert that into the corresponding minor key by subtracting 3. For example, to calculate the C♯ Minor key signature, start with C Major which has a value of 0 and convert to C♯ Major which has a value of 7, and then subtract 3 to get C♯ Minor which has a value of 4.
